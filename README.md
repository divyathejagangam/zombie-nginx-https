# ðŸ§Ÿ Zombie Game Hosted with HTTPS on GCP

A lightweight project to demonstrate how to deploy a static HTML5 zombie shooting game securely over HTTPS using a self-hosted NGINX server on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

---

## ðŸ”’ What This Project Covers

- âœ… Provisioning a GCP Compute Engine VM (e2-micro, Debian)
- âœ… Installing and configuring NGINX
- âœ… Hosting a static HTML game (`testanime.html`)
- âœ… Creating a self-signed TLS certificate using OpenSSL
- âœ… Enabling HTTPS access with NGINX
- âœ… Redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
